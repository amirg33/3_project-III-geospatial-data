## What am I doing?
- The first thing I did is Download the 'Companies' Database in MongoDB. When looking for a location it is important to take into account your competitors and to have them near you. That is why I filtered through the Database and found the Top 10 cities where there are 'Gaming' companies. To do so I went through 

- heatmap de cada empresa

# Task: 
- Choose three cities that exist in your database. From these cities, query and filter the database according to any other criteria if necessary. Then, make API calls to see if the rest of your criteria are met. Then, compare the three cities. Are any of them better than the other two? Using data, justify why.

- Once you chose the city, what would be an approximate location?

- Your result will be a city and a neighbourhood/zip code or adress/coordinates.

- Top 3 cities:
  - Executives: Find about starbucks companies around you - Weight(20%)
  - Account managers: Nearest Central Station in each city find 'centroid' (by lat, lon) do it with c --> find database - Weighted(20%)
  - Everyone is between 25-40: find out pubs and clubs Highest - Weight (60%)
- Justification:
  - Measurement of distances ?
  - Weighted assigning criteria DONE
  - Density of each criteria ? s
